-------------------making this reading file-------------
-------------------Dien--- 17th--Feb-2016---------------
------------------recall what I have changed in SIMC---
----this to check the RC using SIMC for elastic scattering-----

1. infiles/extra_hydrogen.inp 

 - This extra input uses to set up radiative correction mode when we run SIMC

  > option  using_rad = 0    turn off RC
  > option  using_rad = 1    turn on RC

2. dbase.f file

 > in this file Mh is setted to hydrogen mass
 > now we need to change to He3 mass. 
 > So we set Mh = MHe3
 >           targ%Mtar_struck = MHe3


3. radc.f 

 > this file to set up the radiative correction
 > also need to change to use Mh
 > since it was using "mp" to set the ebeam_max and ebeam_min
 > for doing doing_hyd_elast
